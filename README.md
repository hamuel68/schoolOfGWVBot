# School of GWV Assistant Discord Bot
This repo contains the source code for a discord bot created for the [School of GWV](https://discord.gg/k54fFHz45a), a community discord server to help new players learn about Counter-Strike.

## Overview 
The purpose of this bot is to manage help requests from students in the discord server. It is purpose-built for this server only.

Students should be able to submit a help request in existing text channels. After submitting a request (max 1 per channel at any time), it should post a notification to an admin-only channel and tag GWV (or other instructors) so they can easily view all open requests and respond to them.

Other potential features could be added in the future, such as integration with the chatGPT API, for times where no instructor is available.
